# Day 7 - Palindrome Checker 🔄

Today I built a **Palindrome Checker** in Python as part of my **100 Days, 100 Projects Challenge** 🚀  

## 📖 About the Project
A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward.  
Examples: **madam, racecar, 121, 1221, never odd or even**

This Python program checks if the given input is a palindrome or not.  

## 🔑 Key Learnings
- String manipulation in Python  
- Using slicing (`[::-1]`) to reverse strings  
- Handling case sensitivity and spaces  
- Writing reusable functions  

## 🖥️ Example Run

  
   Welcome to Palindrome Checker
   Enter the word/number: madam
   The given madam is a palindrome
  
   Welcome to Palindrome Checker
   Enter the word/number: 121
   The given 121 is a palindrome
